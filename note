When you click and add a new tracker, the page should switch back to "tracker" to show the newly added tracker and not remain on the add tracker page

Name of tracker still appears as you add notes

  // Create an about page maybe - Welcome to HabitFormer & Tracker! With this app, determine the habit (or multiple) you want to track and document it along with date-timestamp to see your progression. Review your existing trackers or add a new one - let's get started!



Q1 - Is there a route type system in React? idk if that is clear but after an action is completed, render a new page. For example, in my example, if you click and add a new tracker, it gets added, but we are still left on the form to create a new tracker page when it should go to the specific tracker page

In my backend, I thought with the create controller method, that's what would happen

def create
  @tracker = Tracker.new(tracker_params)
  if @tracker.save
    render json: @tracker
  else
    render json: {error: "Error Saving"}
  end
end
