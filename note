7/7

When you click and add a new tracker, the page should switch back to "tracker" to show the newly added tracker and not remain on the add tracker page

Name of tracker still appears as you add notes

  // Create an about page maybe - Welcome to HabitFormer & Tracker! With this app, determine the habit (or multiple) you want to track and document it along with date-timestamp to see your progression. Review your existing trackers or add a new one - let's get started!



Q1 - Is there a route type system in React? idk if that is clear but after an action is completed, render a new page. For example, in my example, if you click and add a new tracker, it gets added, but we are still left on the form to create a new tracker page when it should go to the specific tracker page

In my backend, I thought with the create controller method, that's what would happen

def create
  @tracker = Tracker.new(tracker_params)
  if @tracker.save
    render json: @tracker
  else
    render json: {error: "Error Saving"}
  end
end

Q2 - When individual tracker page is being displayed, the tracker name should show up at the top

Q3 - Edit tracker doesn't work (edit action issue with "Cannot read property 'id' of undefined")

TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined
TrackerEdit.handleSubmit
src/components/TrackerEdit.js:21
  18 | handleSubmit = (event) => {
  19 |   event.preventDefault()
  20 |   //console.log(this.props)
> 21 |   let tracker={...this.state, id: this.props.tracker.id}
  22 |   this.props.editTracker(tracker)
  23 |   this.setState({
  24 |     name: '',


this.props
{tracker: undefined, trackers: {…}, editTracker: ƒ}
this.state
{name: "Srija Kumar", description: ""}

so what I am typing is being entered but props.tracker is empty


Q4 - Add note doesnt work either
NoteInput.handleSubmit
src/components/NoteInput.js:22
  19 | handleSubmit = (event) => {
  20 |   event.preventDefault()
  21 |   debugger
> 22 |   this.props.addNote(this.state, this.props.tracker.id)
     | ^  23 |   //gave an error with tracker . id
  24 |   this.setState({
  25 |     date: '',
